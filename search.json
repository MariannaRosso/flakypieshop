Each pie is about 24 cm in diameter and serves 6–10 people — depending, of course, on how generous the slices are.\nOrders can be picked up in Wallisellen, or delivery within the Zürich area may be arranged. Because every pie and dessert is made from scratch — from resting the dough to letting the filling set — please allow at least 4 days’ notice for your order.\n\n\nGet in Touch or Place an Order\n\n\n\nName \nEmail \nPhone Number \n\nWhat would you like?
