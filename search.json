Flaky, buttery layers hold sweet fruits, creamy fillings, or rich spices, baked slowly until golden and bubbling with comfort.\nMade just for you üíõ\nEvery pie and treat is baked fresh to order ‚Äî I only bake after a reservation, so each creation gets the care and time it deserves. I‚Äôm always happy to adapt recipes or flavors for your tastes, and I love working on special requests.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlueberry Cardamom-y Pie\nJuicy blueberries with fragrant cardamom in a golden crust.\nCinnamon Apple Pie with Crumble Topping\nCozy spiced apples tucked under a buttery crumble.\nSalted Maple Pecan Pie\nRich maple sweetness balanced with toasty pecans and a hint of salt.\n\n\n\nBanana Pudding Pie\nLayers of banana, custard, and cookie crumble in a buttery crust.\nKey Lime Pie\nZesty and creamy with a bright citrus punch and a tender crumb base.\n\n\n\nPumpkin Pie\nCreamy spiced pumpkin custard in a crisp, flaky shell ‚Äî autumn in a slice.\n\n\n\nSesame Rice Krispies Treats\nChewy, toasty-sweet bars with a nutty sesame twist.\nCornbread with Bell Pepper Cream and Feta\nSavory-sweet cornbread topped with creamy peppers and tangy feta.\n\nPrices and Order"
