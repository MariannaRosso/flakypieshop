# About {#about}

Hi, I‚Äôm Marianna üçì\
I‚Äôm a researcher by profession ‚Äî and a pastry chef by heart.

Originally from Italy, I trained and became certified in professional pastry before moving to Switzerland in 2016 to pursue my research career.\
Growing up, I spent much of my childhood travelling through the USA, where I fell in love with flaky American pies, cookies, and all things sweet.

Now, as a new mom, I‚Äôve opened a small microbakery from my home ‚Äî a space where I can share my love for pastry while spending precious time with my baby.

# Sweets {#sweets}

Why pies? Flaky, buttery layers hold sweet fruits, creamy fillings, or rich spices, baked slowly until golden and bubbling with comfort.

Made just for you üíõ

Every pie and treat is baked fresh to order ‚Äî I only bake after a reservation, so each creation gets the care and time it deserves. I‚Äôm always happy to adapt recipes or flavors for your tastes, and I love working on special requests.
