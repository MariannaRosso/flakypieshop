**Flaky** is a cozy home microbakery based in Zürich, lovingly baking **American-style pies and treats** — from buttery crusts to nostalgic flavors.

# About {#about}

Hi, I’m Marianna 🍓\
I’m a researcher by profession — and a pastry chef by heart.

Originally from Italy, I trained and became certified in professional pastry before moving to Switzerland in 2016 to pursue my research career.\
Growing up, I spent much of my childhood travelling through the USA, where I fell in love with how flaky American pies are, cookies, and all things sweet.

Now, as a new mom, I’ve opened a small microbakery from my home — a space where I can share my love for pastry while spending precious time with my baby.

# Sweets {#sweets}

Why pies? Flaky, buttery layers hold sweet fruits, creamy fillings, or rich spices, baked slowly until golden and bubbling with comfort.

Made just for you 💛

Every pie and treat is baked fresh to order — I only bake after a reservation, so each creation gets the care and time it deserves. I’m always happy to adapt recipes or flavors for your tastes, and I love working on special requests
