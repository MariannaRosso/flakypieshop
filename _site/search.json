    "text": ":::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaky is a cozy home microbakery based in Wallisellen, just outside Zürich, lovingly baking American-style pies and treats — from buttery crusts to nostalgic flavors.\n\n\nHi, I’m Marianna 🍓\nI’m a researcher by profession — and a pastry chef by heart.\nOriginally from Italy, I trained and became certified in professional pastry before moving to Switzerland in 2016 to pursue my research career.\nGrowing up, I spent much of my childhood travelling through the USA, where I fell in love with flaky American pies, cookies, and all things sweet.\nNow, as a new mom, I’ve opened a small microbakery from my home — a space where I can share my love for pastry while spending precious time with my baby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolat-y Pecan Pie\n\n\n\n\n\nSesame Rice Krispies Treats\n\n\n\n\n\nLemon Ricotta Cheesecake\n\n\n\n\n\nTriple Chocolate Cake\n\n\n\n\n\nBell Pepper and Feta Cornbread\n\n\n\nWhy pies? Flaky, buttery layers hold sweet fruits, creamy fillings, or rich spices, baked slowly until golden and bubbling with comfort.\nMade just for you 💛\nEvery pie and treat is baked fresh to order — I only bake after a reservation, so each creation gets the care and time it deserves. I’m always happy to adapt recipes or flavors for your tastes, and I love working on special requests.\n\n\n\n\n\nCinnamon Apple Crumble Pie\nCozy spiced apples tucked under a buttery crumble.\nBlueberry Maple Chess Pie\nThe taste of a maple syrup soaked pancake in a slice.\nChocolat-y Pecan Pie\nThe richness of dark chocolate with toasty pecans and a hint of salt.\n\n\n\nPumpkin Pie\nCreamy spiced pumpkin custard in a crisp, flaky shell — fall in a slice.\n\n\n\nSesame Rice Krispies Treats\nChewy, toasty-sweet bars with a nutty sesame twist.\nBell Pepper and Feta Cornbread\nSavory-sweet cornbread topped with creamy peppers and tangy feta.\n\n\n\n\nPrices and Order\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nPsst… I programmed this website myself in Quarto, the code is available here.\n\n\n\nEnglish | Deutsch"
